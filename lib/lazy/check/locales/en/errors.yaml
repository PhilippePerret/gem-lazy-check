# -- Erreurs de recette --
200: |
  The recipe file '%{path}' could not be found.
201: |
  The data %{a} is not valid for instantiating a Checker::Url. It should 
  be either a (valid) URL or valid HTML code.
202: |
  The recipe file does not contain any data.
203: |
  The recipe data should be a table (Hash), not a %{c}.
204: |
  The recipe should define the key :tests. It only defines the keys %{ks}.
205: |
  The :tests data should be an Array, not a %{c}.
206: |
  The recipe should define its name with the key :name.

# -- Errors in test definition. --

300: |
  The test data should be a Hash table, not a %{c}.
301: |
  The test table should define the :url property, which is the page to reach.
  I only find the %{ks} properties.
302: |
  The provided URL (%{u}) is not valid: %{e}.
303: |
  it must be defined, not nil.
304: |
  it must be a string, not a %{c}.
305: |
  it must start with 'http' or 'https' necessarily.
306: |
  it should not contain any spaces.
307: |
  A test must define its name (in :name); it only defines the keys %{ks}.
308: |
  A test must define the checks to perform in a property called, specifically, 
  :checks. The test only defines the %{ks} properties.
309: |
  The checks to be performed for the test (:checks) should be a list (Array), 
  not a %{c}.
310: |
  The redirection %{a} should be a string, not a %{c}.
311: |
  The redirection %{a} should start with 'http[s]'.
312: |
  To test the HTTP response, you must provide the expected status code, which should 
  be an Integer. However, %{a} is a %{c}.
  For example, you can use: 404.

1000: |
  Lazy::Checker::CheckCase instanciation requires a Lazy::Checker::Url (first argument).
  Actual value is %{a}::%{c}.
1001: |
  Lazy::Checker::CheckCase instanciation requires a Hash (second argument).
  Actual value is %{a}::%{c}.
1002: |
  CheckCase data should define :tag value (tag name with at least id or css class).
  They only define : %{ks}.
1003: |
  :tag value of the CheckCase data should define at least a id (tagName#id) or a css 
  class (tagName.css_class). '%{a}' defines neither.
1004: |
  In the :tag data, :count (%{a}) should be a number, not a %{c}.
2000: |
  The definition of :contains is incorrect. It should be a table (defining at 
  least :tag), a string (text to be contained or a tag with an identifier and/or 
  CSS class), or a list of these elements. The class of the element, in any case, 
  cannot be %{c}.

# --- Errors in page check. ---

4999: |
  No %{tag} element was found when %{e} were expected.
5000: |
  Wrong count. We expected %{e} %{tag} elements, but found %{a} on the page.
5001: |
  The content of %{tag} should be empty, but it contains the text 
  "%{a}".
5002: |
  The content of %{tag} should not be empty, but it is.
5003: |
  The content of %{tag} should not contain any text, but it 
  contains %{a}.
5004: |
  The content of %{tag} should contain text, but it doesn't display any.
5010: |
  We should find %{tag} containing %{e}. The following issues were 
  encountered: %{a}.
5011: |
  We should find %{tag} containing the text %{e}.
5020: |
  should contain the string %{e}
5021: |
  should contain the tag defined by %{e}
5030: |
  should define the attributes
5031: |
  missing or unequal attributes: %{e}.
5032: |
  the content is not long enough. It should be at least %{e} characters long, 
  but it is %{a} characters long.
5033: |
  the content is too long. It should be less than %{e} characters, but it 
  is %{a} characters long.

5500: |
  The URL is not redirected. It should have been redirected to 
  %{e}.
5501: |
  The URL is redirected to the wrong address. It should have been redirected to: %{e}.
  It is redirected to: %{a}.
5502: |
  The expected HTTP Response is not correct...
  We were expecting the response: %{e}
  We received the response: %{a}
5503: |
  Error 404. The page %{e} could not be found.
6000: |
  The first argument of Lazy::Checker.check must be valid XML code. 
  However, %{se}.
6001: |
  %{a} is not a String; it's a %{c}.
6002: |
  a valid XML code should be wrapped in a root node. This is not the case 
  for %{a}.
6003: |
  the data is null (nil).
6010: |
  The second argument of Lazy::Checker.check must be a valid Hash table, containing
  the correct keys: %{se}.
6011: |
  %{a} is not a Hash; it's a %{c}.
